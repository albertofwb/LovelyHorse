	NOTICE:
		please do not install this program on people's computer unless you
	get their permission. Because this program will take screenshots and send
	them to remote server which infringe on the privacy of others



I would like to add a few of security related functions to this program. Below two functions come to my mind firstly when I set down in a library at May 1st 2019.

* make a screenshot when user typed some sensitive words
* upload the screenshot to remote server (which haven't implement yet I may write it with golang or python-flask)



Security related features:

* this program will start at boot and hide its process name from windows tasklist



## Principles and purposes

* I made this program for practicing windows hacker programming skills.
* I also want make it a interesting network program so the beginners who are interested at network security can find a  a program containing a series of interesting hacking techniques which may inspire them to go further rather not the textbook style bored samples just makes people sleepy.



## Reference

The most code of this program are referenced of a book called 《windows黑客编程技术详解》-甘迪文
